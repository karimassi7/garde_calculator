# Test Score Grader in C

This is a simple C program that:

- Asks the user for the number of test scores (1 to 10).
- Takes input for each test score (between 0 and 100).
- Calculates the total and average score.
- Assigns a letter grade based on the average.

## How it works

1. `Get_test()`: Prompts for the number of tests.
2. `calcul_TOTALEOfScorres()`: Calculates the total score.
3. `CALCULE_average()`: Calculates the average.
4. `getLetterGrade()`: Converts average to a letter grade (A–E).
5. `main()`: Gathers input and displays the result.

## Grade Scale

- A: 90–100  
- B: 80–89  
- C: 70–79  
- D: 60–69  
- E: Below 60
